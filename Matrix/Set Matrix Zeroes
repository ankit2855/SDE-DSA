// Leetcode

// The idea is to use the first row and first column of the matrix
// as auxiliary arrays so that we can mark whether a current element is zero or not
// Say a[i][j] element is 0 so we mark arr[i][0] and arr[0][j] = 0;

class Solution {

    void setZeroes(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
  
    // Since first cell for both first row and first column is the same i.e. matrix[0][0]
      // We can use an additional variable for either the first row/column.
      // For this solution we are using an additional variable for the first column
      // and using matrix[0][0] for the first row.

        // even when actually matrix[i][0] was not 0, it was made 0 because the column contained 0.
